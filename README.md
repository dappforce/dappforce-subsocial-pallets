# Subsocial Pallets for Substrate v1 by [DappForce](https://github.com/dappforce)

⚠️ Note that this version of Subsocial is implemented on top of [Substrate v1 (April 12, 2019)](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/commit/6dfc3e8b057bb00322136251a0f10305fbb1ad8f). After Subsocial migrated to Substrate v2, its development moved to another repo: [dappforce-subsocial-node](https://github.com/dappforce/dappforce-subsocial-node)

## What is Subsocial?

Subsocial is a set of Substrate pallets with web UI that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized censorship-resistant social network aka community. Every community can be a separate Substrate chain and connect with other communities via a Polkadot-based relay chain.

You can think of this as decentralized versions of Reddit, Stack Exchange or Medium, where subreddits or communities of Stack Exchange or blogs on Medium run on their own chain. At the same time, users of these decentralized communities should be able to share their reputation or transfer coins and other values from one community to another via Polkadot relay chain.
